MyManus
========
 
MyManus is the 100% free, 0% coding, agentic environment akin to [Manus AI](https://manus.im/) build entirely around Model Context Protocol [MCP][https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction] implementation.

What that means is that all you need is [MCP Client](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients), say Claude Desktop app and a bunch of existing [MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/examples) and a magic [prompt](./prompts/prompt.md), to set up you ultimate agentic anvironment wllowing AI agent to do all the tasks you can imagine. No need to write a single line of code. No need to purchase additional software (apart from existing [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/) subscription or LLM API).

REASEARCH, CODING, DATA ANALYSIS, PRODUCTIVITY, LIFE, you name it. Depending on the set of tools it can be used for any task you can imagine.
