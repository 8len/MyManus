MyManus
========
 
MyManus is the 100% free, 0% coding, **local**, **secure** agentic environment akin to [Manus AI](https://manus.im/) build entirely around Model Context Protocol [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) implementation.

MyManus uses sandboxing to secure your system and allow AI agent to use a browser, create files, run commands, and more.

My Manus securely runs browser on local machine rather than on some flimsy cloud server, which makes it fast, free and reliable.

Thanks to its magic [prompt](./prompts/prompt.md), MyManus plans, reasons, executes, evaluates and deals with all the issue on its own. 

REASEARCH, CODING, DATA ANALYSIS, PRODUCTIVITY, LIFE, you name it. Depending on the set of tools it can be used for any task you can imagine.

All that you need is [Claude Desktop](https://github.com/emsi/claude-desktop) app (or any other [MCP Client](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients)) and a bunch of existing [MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/examples) to set up your ultimate agentic anvironment, allowing AI agent to do all the tasks you can imagine. No need to write a single line of code. No need to purchase additional software (apart from existing [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/) subscription or LLM API).
